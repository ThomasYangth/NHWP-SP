*Non-Hermitian Wave Packet - Saddle Point*
By Tian-Hua Yang [yangth@princeton.edu]

This is a Python-Mathematica package to numerically perform time evolution of wave packets governed by non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians, and theoretically calculate the saddle points that would govern the long-time behavior of such evolutions.

See our paper on arxiv: [arxiv:](arxiv:2501.xxxxx).

## Dependencies

- Wolfram Mathematica in the command line. Either install "wolframscript" or "math". Make sure to open *SPCalcs.wls* and set the `CommandLine` and `StartIndex` arguments.

- *(Optional)* cupy. 

- *(Optional)* ffmpeg.

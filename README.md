*Non-Hermitian Wave Packet - Saddle Point*
By Tian-Hua Yang [yangth@princeton.edu]

This is a Python-Mathematica package to numerically perform time evolution of wave packets governed by non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians, and theoretically calculate the saddle points that would govern the long-time behavior of such evolutions.
